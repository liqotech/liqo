            Hi @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}. Thanks for your PR!

            I am @adamjensenbot.
            You can interact with me issuing a **slash command** in the first line of a **comment**.
            Currently, I understand the following commands:
            * `/rebase`:            Rebase this PR onto the master branch (You can add the option `test=true` to launch the tests
              when the rebase operation is completed)
            * `/merge`:             Merge this PR into the master branch
            * `/build`              Build Liqo components
            * `/test`               Launch the E2E and Unit tests
            * `/hold`, `/unhold`    Add/remove the hold label to prevent merging with /merge

            Make sure this PR appears in the **${{ github.event.repository.name }} changelog**, adding one of the following **labels**:
            * `kind/breaking`:      :boom: Breaking Change
            * `kind/feature`:       :rocket: New Feature
