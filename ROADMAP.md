# Roadmap

Planned features for the next release (v0.6, expected Oct 2022) include the following:

* Extend the support to offload applications that need to contact the local API Server (e.g. operators and some DB applications).
* Improve the observability and the robustness of the network fabric.
* Provide the possibility to better schedule and orchestrate workloads using policies.
