## About the project

Liqo is a platform to enable dynamic and decentralized resource sharing across Kubernetes clusters, either on-prem or managed. Liqo allows to run pods on a remote cluster seamlessly and without any modification of Kubernetes and the applications. With Liqo it is possible to extend the control plane of a Kubernetes cluster across the cluster's boundaries, making multi-cluster native and transparent: collapse an entire remote cluster to a virtual local node, by allowing workloads offloading and resource management compliant with the standard Kubernetes approach.

## Main features

* **Decentralized governance**: peer-to-peer paradigm, without any centralized management entity.
* **Clusters discovery**: leverage on three different ways to discover (and peer to) other clusters:
  * Manual configuration: through a custom API representing other clusters
  * DNS: automatic discovery through DNS records
  * LAN: automatic discovery of neighboring clusters available in the same LAN.
* **Transparent offloading**: pods scheduled on the virtual node are offloaded to the remote cluster; they can be controlled by merely accessing the pod objects in the local one; the resources needed by the pods (services, endpoints, configmaps, etc.) are translated and replicated remotely. It allows inter-cluster pod-to-pod and pod-to-service communication.
* **Pod resilience**: the offloaded pods' lifecycle is controlled by a remote replicaset.
* **Inter-cluster networking**: the clusters inter-connection is implemented by a Wireguard tunnel, which ensure encryption and reliability.
* **CNI independence**: compliance with many CNIs (Calico, Cilium, Flannel, etc.) even in heterogeneous scenarios (the two clusters can have different CNIs).

## Quickstart

This quickstart lets you try Liqo in a playground environment built by two clusters in [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

### Install liqoctl

First, set the variables corresponding to your set-up:

```
OS=linux # possible values: linux,windows,darwin
ARCH=amd64 # possible values: amd64,arm64 
```

Then, you should execute the following commands to install the latest version of liqoctl:

```
curl --fail -LSO "https://get.liqo.io/liqoctl-${OS}-${ARCH}" && \
chmod +x "liqoctl-${OS}-${ARCH}" && \
sudo mv "liqoctl-${OS}-${ARCH}" /usr/local/bin/liqoctl
```

Alternatively, you can directly download liqoctl from the [Liqo releases](https://github.com/liqotech/liqo/releases/) page on GitHub.


### __Provision__ two KinD clusters.

```bash
source <(curl -L https://get.liqo.io/clusters.sh)
```

#### __Install__ Liqo on both clusters:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_1
liqoctl install kind --cluster-name cluster1
export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_2
liqoctl install kind --cluster-name cluster2
```

Wait that all containers are up and running. When a new virtual-kubelet pops out, a new node modeling the remote cluster is present and ready to receive pods. Check it out with:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

#### __Use__ the resources

Create a new namespace and label it to tell Liqo that the pods created in that namespace are suitable for offloading in the remote cluster.

```bash
kubectl create namespace liqo-demo
kubectl label namespace liqo-demo liqo.io/enabled=true
```

Deploy the [Google microservice Shop](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) application. 

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://get.liqo.io/app.yaml -n liqo-demo
```

You can observe that:

* Your application is correctly working by exposing the application frontend port and later connecting with a browser to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000). To expose the pod port:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n liqo-demo service/frontend 8080:80
```

* Your application is transparently deployed across two different clusters:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n liqo-demo -o wide  
```

### Going Further

If you want to explore the Liqo internals, including how to inspect and interact with a service deployed with Liqo, you can explore the documentation website:

* Continue the Liqo journey by exploring the [Liqo playground](https://doc.liqo.io/gettingstarted/)
* Find out how to install Liqo on [your clusters](https://doc.liqo.io/installation/)

## Roadmap

Planned features for the next release (v0.3, expected early-September, 2021) are the following:

* Support for deployments spanning across more than two clusters.
* Support for a more balanced scheduling mechanism to distribute jobs across clusters.
* Support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.
* Support for more granular permission control over remote cluster resources.

## Contributing

All contributors are warmly welcome. If you want to become a new contributor, we are so happy!. Just, before doing it, read the repo's guidelines presented on our [documentation website](https://doc.liqo.io/contributing/).
