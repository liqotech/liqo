## What is Liqo?

Liqo is an open-source project that enables dynamic and seamless Kubernetes multi-cluster topologies, supporting heterogeneous on-premise, cloud and edge infrastructures.

## What does it provide?

* **Peering**: automatic peer-to-peer establishment of resource and service consumption relationships between independent and heterogeneous clusters.
  No need to worry about complex VPN configurations and certification authorities: everything is transparently self-negotiated for you.
* **Offloading**: seamless workloads offloading to remote clusters, without requiring any modification to Kubernetes or the applications themselves.
  Multi-cluster is made native and transparent: collapse an entire remote cluster to a virtual node compliant with the standard Kubernetes approaches and tools.
* **Network fabric**: transparent multi-cluster pod-to-pod and pod-to-service connectivity, regardless of the underlying configurations and CNI plugins.
  Natively access the services exported by remote clusters, and spread interconnected application components across multiple infrastructures, with all cross-cluster traffic flowing through secured network tunnels.
* **Storage fabric**: support for remote execution of stateful workloads, according to the data gravity approach.
  Seamlessly extend standard (e.g., database) high availability deployment techniques to the multi-cluster scenarios, for increased guarantees.
  All without the complexity of managing multiple independent cluster and application replicas.

## Quick start

Would you like to quickly join the fray and experiment with Liqo?
Set up your playground and check out the getting started examples, which will guide you through a scenario-driven tour of the most notable features of Liqo:

* [Quick Start](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/quick-start.html): grasp a quick overview of what Liqo can do.
* [Offloading with Policies](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/offloading-with-policies.html): discover how to tune namespace offloading, and how to use policies to select which clusters may host each workload.
* [Offloading a Service](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/service-offloading.html): learn how to create a multi-cluster service, and how to consume it from each connected cluster.
* [Stateful Applications](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/stateful-applications.html): find out how to deploy a database across a multi-cluster environment, leveraging the Liqo storage fabric.
* [Global Ingress](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/global-ingress.html): discover how route external traffic to multi-cluster applications through a global ingress and automatic DNS configurations.
* [Replicated Deployments](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/replicated-deployments.html): learn how to deploy an application by replicating it on multiple remote clusters.
* [Provision with Terraform](https://docs.liqo.io/en/stable/examples/provision-with-terraform.html): explore Liqo Terraform provider capabilities.
