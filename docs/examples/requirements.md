# Examples requirements

Before starting the tutorials below, you should ensure the following software is installed on your system:

* [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), the container runtime.
* [**Kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), the command-line tool for Kubernetes.
* [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), the package manager for Kubernetes.
* [**curl**](https://curl.se/), to interact with the tutorial applications through HTTP/HTTPS.
* [**KinD**](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation), the Kubernetes in Docker runtime.
* [**liqoctl**](/installation/liqoctl.md) command-line tool to interact with Liqo.

The following tutorials were tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL2 and Docker Desktop).

To prevent issues with tutorials leveraging more than two clusters, on some systems you may need to increase the maximum number of *inotify* watches:

```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=52428899
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=2048
```
