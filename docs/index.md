# What is Liqo?

Liqo is an open-source project that enables **dynamic and seamless Kubernetes multi-cluster topologies**, supporting heterogeneous on-premise, cloud and edge infrastructures.

## What does it provide?

```{grid-item-card}
:class-header: sd-fs-5 sd-pt-3
:link: features/peering
:link-type: doc

{fa}`link;1.5rem` Peering
^^^

Automatic peer-to-peer establishment of **resource and service consumption relationships** between independent and heterogeneous clusters.
No need to worry about complex VPN configurations and certification authorities: everything is transparently **self-negotiated** for you.
```

```{grid-item-card}
:class-header: sd-fs-5 sd-pt-3
:link: features/offloading
:link-type: doc

{fa}`paper-plane;1.5rem` Offloading
^^^

Seamless **workloads offloading** to remote clusters, without requiring any modification to Kubernetes or the applications themselves.
**Multi-cluster is made native and transparent**: collapse an entire remote cluster to a **virtual node** compliant with the standard Kubernetes approaches and tools.
```

```{grid-item-card}
:class-header: sd-fs-5 sd-pt-3
:link: features/network-fabric
:link-type: doc

{fa}`globe;1.5rem` Network Fabric
^^^

A transparent **network fabric**, enabling multi-cluster **pod-to-pod** and **pod-to-service** connectivity, regardless of the underlying configurations and CNI plugins.
Natively **access the services** exported by remote clusters, and spread interconnected application components across multiple infrastructures, with all cross-cluster traffic flowing through **secured network tunnels**.
```

```{grid-item-card}
:class-header: sd-fs-5 sd-pt-3
:link: features/storage-fabric
:link-type: doc

{fa}`archive;1.5rem` Storage Fabric
^^^

A native **storage fabric**, supporting the remote execution of **stateful workloads** according to the **data gravity** approach.
Seamlessly extend standard (e.g., database) **high availability deployment techniques** to the multi-cluster scenarios, for **increased guarantees**.
All without the complexity of managing multiple independent cluster and application replicas.
