# Liqo CLI tool

## Introduction

Liqoctl is the CLI tool to streamline the **installation** and **management** of Liqo.
Specifically, it abstracts the creation and modification of Liqo-defined custom resources, allowing to:

* **Install/uninstall** Liqo, wrapping the corresponding Helm commands and automatically retrieving the appropriate parameters based on the target cluster configuration.
* Establish and revoke **peering** relationships towards remote clusters.
* Enable and configure **workload offloading** on a per-namespace basis.
* Retrieve the **status** of Liqo, as well as of given peering relationships and offloading setups.

```{warning}
Make sure to always **use the *liqoctl* version matching that of Liqo** installed (or to be installed) in your cluster(s).
```

```{admonition} Note
*liqoctl* displays a *kubectl* compatible behavior concerning Kubernetes API access, hence supporting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, as well as all the standard flags, including `--kubeconfig` and `--context`.
Moreover, subcommands interacting with two clusters (e.g., *liqoctl peer*) feature a parallel set of flags concerning Kubernetes API access to the remote cluster, in the form `--remote-<flag>` (e.g., `--remote-kubeconfig`, `--remote-context`).

## Install liqoctl with Homebrew

If you are using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager, you can install *liqoctl* with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install liqoctl
```

When installed with Homebrew, autocompletion scripts are automatically configured and should work out of the box.

## Install liqoctl with asdf

If you are using the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) runtime manager, you can install *liqoctl* with asdf:

```bash
# Add the liqoctl plugin for asdf
asdf plugin add liqoctl

# List all installable versions
asdf list-all liqoctl

# Install the desired version
asdf install liqoctl <version>

# set it as the global version, unless a project declares it otherwise locally
asdf global liqoctl <version>
```

## Install liqoctl manually

You can download and install *liqoctl* manually, following the appropriate instructions based on your operating system and architecture.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Linux

Download *liqoctl* and move it to a file location in your system `PATH`:

**AMD64:**

{{ env.config.html_context.generate_liqoctl_install('linux', 'amd64') }}

**ARM64:**

{{ env.config.html_context.generate_liqoctl_install('linux', 'arm64') }}

```{admonition} Note
Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
```
````

````{tab-item} MacOS

Download *liqoctl*, make it executable, and move it to a file location in your system `PATH`:

**Intel:**

{{ env.config.html_context.generate_liqoctl_install('darwin', 'amd64') }}

**Apple Silicon:**

{{ env.config.html_context.generate_liqoctl_install('darwin', 'arm64') }}

```{admonition} Note
Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
```
````

````{tab-item} Windows

Download the *liqoctl* binary:

{{ env.config.html_context.generate_liqoctl_install('windows', 'amd64') }}

And move it to a file location in your system `PATH`.

````
`````

Alternatively, you can manually download *liqoctl* from the [Liqo releases](https://github.com/liqotech/liqo/releases/) page on GitHub.

## Install Kubectl plugin with Krew

You can install liqoctl as a kubectl plugin by using the [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) plugin manager:

```bash
kubectl krew install liqo
```

Then, all commands shall be invoked with `kubectl liqo` rather than `liqoctl`, although all functionalities remain the same.

```{warning}
While the kubectl plugin is supported, it is recommended to use liqoctl as this enables a better experience via tab auto-completion.
[Install it with Homebrew](InstallationLiqoctlWithHomebrew) if available on your system or by [manually downloading the binary from GitHub](InstallationLiqoctlManually).
```

(InstallationLiqoctlFromSource)=

## Install liqoctl from source

You can install *liqoctl* building it from source.
To do so, clone the Liqo repository, build the *liqoctl* binary, and move it to a file location in your system `PATH`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liqotech/liqo.git
cd liqo
make ctl
mv liqoctl /usr/local/bin/liqoctl
```

## Enable shell autocompletion

*liqoctl* provides autocompletion support for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Bash

The *liqoctl* completion script for Bash can be generated with the `liqoctl completion bash` command.
Sourcing the completion script in your shell enables *liqoctl* autocompletion.

However, the completion script depends on *bash-completion*, which means that you have to install this software first.
You can test if you have *bash-completion* already installed by running `type _init_completion`.
If it returns an error, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

```bash
source <(liqoctl completion bash)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

```bash
source <(liqoctl completion bash) >> ~/.bashrc
```

After reloading your shell, *liqoctl* autocompletion should be working.
````

````{tab-item} Zsh

The *liqoctl* completion script for Zsh can be generated with the `liqoctl completion zsh` command.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you will need to enable it.
You can execute the following once:

```zsh
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:

```zsh
liqoctl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_liqoctl"
```

After reloading your shell, *liqoctl* autocompletion should be working.
````

````{tab-item} Fish

The *liqoctl* completion script for Fish can be generated with the `liqoctl completion fish` command.

To load completions in your current shell session:

```fish
liqoctl completion fish | source
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

```fish
liqoctl completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/liqoctl.fish
```

After reloading your shell, *liqoctl* autocompletion should be working.
````

````{tab-item} PowerShell

The *liqoctl* completion script for PowerShell can be generated with the `liqoctl completion powershell` command.

To load completions in your current shell session:

```powershell
liqoctl completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

To load completions for every new session, add the output of the above command
to your PowerShell profile.

After reloading your shell, *liqoctl* autocompletion should be working.
