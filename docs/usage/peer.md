# Peer two Clusters

This section describes the procedure to **establish a peering** with a remote provider cluster.

## Overview

The peering process leverages **[liqoctl](/installation/liqoctl.md)** to interact with the clusters, abstracting the creation and update of the appropriate custom resources.
To this end, it:

- creates the networking fabric to securely enable the communication between the two clusters,
- authenticates the consumer with the provider
- ask the provider for a certain amount of resource to schedule the workloads
- creates a VirtualNode on the consumer to schedule workloads and consume provider resources.

As a result, a new `ForeignCluster` resource is created, which **represents a remote cluster** and is univocally identified by its identity (i.e., cluster ID).
Additionally, its status reports a **summary of the current peering status**, including the role (i.e, *consumer* and/or *provider*), the associated authentication and networking endpoints, and the peering conditions for each module (i.e., whether the networking/authentication/offloading is established, and the status of its associated resources).

The following sections present the respective procedures to **peer a local cluster A** (i.e., the *consumer*), with a **remote cluster B** (i.e., the *provider*).
At the end of the process, a new **virtual node** is created in the consumer, abstracting the resources shared by the provider, and enabling seamless **pod offloading** to the remote cluster.
Additional details are also provided to enable the reverse peering direction, hence achieving a **bidirectional peering**, allowing both clusters to offload a part of their workloads to the other.

All examples leverage two different *contexts* to refer to *consumer* and *provider* clusters, respectively named `consumer` and `provider`.

```{admonition} Note
*liqoctl* displays a *kubectl* compatible behavior concerning Kubernetes API access, hence supporting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, as well as all the standard flags, including `--kubeconfig` and `--context`.
Ensure you selected the correct target cluster before issuing *liqoctl* commands (as you would do with *kubectl*).
```

## Requirements

The peering command requires the user to provide the kubeconfig of **both** *consumer* and *provider* clusters, as it will apply resources on both clusters.
To perform a peering without having access to both clusters, you need to manually apply on your cluster the resources and exchange with the remote cluster all the resources needed over out-of-band mediums (refer to the individual guides describing the procedure for each module).

## Performed steps

The peering command enables all 3 liqo modules and performs the following steps:

1. **enables networking**.
Exchanges network configurations and creates the two **gateways** (server in the provider, client in the consumer) to let the two clusters communicate over a secure tunnel.
2. **enables authentication**.
Authenticates the consumer with the provider.
In this step, the consumer obtains an `Identity` (*kubeconfig*) to replicate resources to the provider cluster.
3. **enables offloading**.
The consumer creates and replicates to the provider a `ResourceSlice`, to ask and obtain an `Identity` to consume a fixed amount of resources from the provider.
At the end of the process, the consumer obtains a **virtual node** to schedule workloads.

The command is intended to be a wrapper to simplify the peering process.
You can configure and fine-tune each module separately using the individual commands:

1. [`liqoctl network` (networking module)](/advanced/peering/inter-cluster-network.md)

2. [`liqoctl authenticate` (authentication module)](/advanced/peering/inter-cluster-authentication.md)

3. [`liqoctl create resourceslice` or `liqoctl create virtualnode` (offloading module)](/advanced/peering/namespace-offloading.md)

For the majority and the cases the `liqoctl peer` is enough.
However, **to know the best strategy for each case and the requirements of each approach, check the [peering strategies guide](/advanced/peering-strategies.md)**.

### Peering establishment

To proceed, ensure that you are operating in the *consumer* cluster, and then issue the *liqoctl peer* command:

```bash
liqoctl --kubeconfig=$CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH peer --remote-kubeconfig $PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG_PATH 
```

```{warning}
The establishment of a peering with a remote cluster leveraging a **different version of Liqo**, net of patch releases, is currently **not supported**, and could lead to unexpected results.
```

You should see the following output:

```text
 INFO   (local) Network configuration correctly retrieved
 INFO   (remote) Network configuration correctly retrieved
 INFO   (local) Network configuration correctly set up
 INFO   (remote) Network configuration correctly set up

```

## Results

The command configures the above-described modules.
It waits for the different modules to be set correctly (this might require a few seconds, depending on the download time of the required images).
At the end, a new *ForeignCluster* resource will appear on both clusters, containing the status of the peering.

The *ForeignCluster* resource can be inspected through *kubectl*:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig $CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH get foreignclusters
```

If the peering process is completed successfully, you should observe an output similar to the following.
In the consumer cluster:

```text
:caption: "Cluster consumer"
NAME       ROLE       AGE
cl-provider   Provider   110s
```

In the provider cluster:

```text
:caption: "Cluster provider"
NAME       ROLE       AGE
cl-consumer   Consumer   3m16s
```

At the same time, a new *virtual node* has been created in the *consumer* cluster.
Specifically:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig $CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH get nodes -l liqo.io/type=virtual-node
```

Should return an output similar to the following:

```text
NAME       STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
provider   Ready    agent   4m53s   v1.29.1
```

```{admonition} Note
The name of the `ForeignCluster` resources, as well as that of the *virtual node*, reflects the cluster IDs specified for the two clusters.
```

## Bidirectional peering

Once the peering from the *consumer* to the *provider* has been established, the reverse direction (i.e., leading to a bidirectional peering) can be enabled through the same procedure.

```bash
liqoctl --kubeconfig $PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG_PATH peer --remote-kubeconfig $CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH
```

## Tear down

A peering can be disabled by leveraging the symmetric `liqoctl unpeer` command, causing the local virtual node (abstracting the remote cluster) to be destroyed, and all offloaded workloads to be rescheduled:

```bash
liqoctl --kubeconfig $CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH unpeer --remote-kubeconfig $PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG_PATH
```

The reverse peering direction, if any, is preserved, and the remote cluster can continue offloading workloads to its virtual node representing the local cluster.
Hence, the specular command shall be executed on the opposite clusters to completely tear down a bidirectional peering.

```bash
liqoctl --kubeconfig $PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG_PATH unpeer --remote-kubeconfig $CONSUMER_KUBECONFIG_PATH
```
