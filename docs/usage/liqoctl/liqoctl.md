# liqoctl

A CLI tool to install and manage Liqo

## Description

### Synopsis

liqoctl is a CLI tool to install and manage Liqo.

Liqo is a platform to enable dynamic and decentralized resource sharing across
Kubernetes clusters, either on-prem or managed. Liqo allows to run pods on a
remote cluster seamlessly and without any modification of Kubernetes and the
applications. With Liqo it is possible to extend the control and data plane of a
Kubernetes cluster across the cluster's boundaries, making multi-cluster native
and transparent: collapse an entire remote cluster to a local virtual node,
enabling workloads offloading, resource management and cross-cluster communication
compliant with the standard Kubernetes approach.
