After having installed Liqo, you are now ready to use it and offload your applications.

Liqo extends the semantic of some common Kubernetes objects (deployment, service, namespace) to fit in a multi-cluster topology, as presented in [concepts](../concepts/).

The basic operations you can perform with Liqo are the following:

* [Establish a peering](./peering)
* [Configure namespace offloading on remote clusters](./namespace_offloading/)
