// Package ipamcore provides the core functionality for the IPAM service.
//
// The IPAM is organized like a binary tree, where each node represents a network.
// In order to optimize the network allocation we use buddy mmory allocation alghorithm
// to allocate networks like they are memory blocks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation).
// When a network is splitted in two, the left child represents the first half of the network, while the right child
// represents the second half. The splitting is done until the network is splitted in blocks of the desired size.
