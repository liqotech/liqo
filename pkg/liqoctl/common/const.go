Liqo is a platform to enable dynamic and decentralized resource sharing across Kubernetes clusters. 
Liqo allows to run pods on a remote cluster seamlessly and without any modification of 
Kubernetes and the applications. 
With Liqo it is possible to extend the control plane of a Kubernetes cluster across the cluster's boundaries, 
making multi-cluster native and transparent: collapse an entire remote cluster to a virtual local node, 
by allowing workloads offloading and resource management compliant with the standard Kubernetes approach.`
