// Package concurrent contains the logic to manage same gateway replicas.
// They are managed using an active/passive approach.
// The gateway container try to acquire the active role using the controller manager lease.
// Then, the active gateway is labeled with the ActiveGatewayKey and ActiveGatewayValue, and the passive gateways are unlabeled.
// The gateway service target the active gateway using the ActiveGatewayKey and ActiveGatewayValue labels.
// In order to cohordinate the sidecar containers, the gateway uses a unix socket to manage the IPC, and to start the sidecars when it becomes leader.
