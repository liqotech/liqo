// Package podstatusctrl implements a controller that enforces the presence/absence of the remote unavailable label on
// local offloaded pods. The presence of the label indicates that the status of the offloaded pod can be managed/updated by the local
// cluster and can't currently be reflected/updated from the remote cluster, likely due to a remote cluster failure.
