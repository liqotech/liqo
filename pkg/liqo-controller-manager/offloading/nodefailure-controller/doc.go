// Package nodefailurectrl contains a controller that enforces a logic that
// ensure offloaded pods running on a failed node are evicted and rescheduled
// on a healthy node, preventing them to remain in a terminating state indefinitely.
// This feature can be useful in case of remote node failure to guarantee better
// service continuity and to have the expected pods workload on the remote cluster
